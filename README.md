# Smart Home Project
A smart home is an undergraduate project made for "Sensors" course, was taught by Dr.Eman El-Gendy 2019, computer engineering major. It was made using `Arduino` Uno.

Note:
1. You need download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to be able to use the code.
2. You can try the code using simulation software like: [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/) or [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), or you can implement the hardware design of the code.

## Used Components
- Arduino Uno                           ==> Centralized Control
- LM 37 DZ (Temperature Sensor)         ==> Senses any change (specially increasing) in temperature
- DC Motor                              ==> Turn on/off the window based on temperature, the time of the day & the light
- Servo Motor                           ==> Turn on/off the door of the home
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistors)       ==> Senses the change of the outdoor and indoor lighting of the home
- LEDs (330 Ohm)                        ==> The main lighting system
- 16 * 2 LCD                            ==> View and control the system (password, time, control, stats, â€¦)
- Transistors (NPN)                     ==> Control a fan and lighting
- Ultrasonic                            ==> Senses if there is someone in front of the door
- Bluetooth Module                      ==> Control parts of the system remotely
- (DHT 11) Temperature-Humidity Sensor  ==> Senses the indoor humidity of the home
- 4 * 4 Keypad                          ==> Enter the password & navigation on the LCD
